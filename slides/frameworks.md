##  Frameworks

### babel
To use the modern language features (and also support older browsers). Transpiles
JavaScript to ES5. Provides polyfills for various features.

### webpack

Module loading and bundling. Also allows to import CSS (or SASS/LESS) files and
creates a single bundle. Tricky configuration.

### browserify

Slightly easier than webpack, but no style loading.
